The purpose of this mobile application project is to provide an efficient and streamlined system for managing various aspects of warehouse operations. The application will consist of four sub-systems: Employee management, Stock management, Site/Place management, and Delivery management.

Employee management is used to manage the details of the employees, who are working at the warehouse. Stock management is used to manage the stock details, and site management is used to keep the details of the sites or places to store the stocks. Finally, delivery management is used to manage the delivery details.
